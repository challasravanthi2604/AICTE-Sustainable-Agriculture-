# AICTE Sustainable Agriculture

This project uses Machine Learning techniques to predict crop yield and sustainable farming outcomes using environmental and agricultural data.

## 📌 Project Overview

Sustainable Agriculture is an AI-powered project that aims to help farmers make informed decisions by predicting agricultural outputs based on soil health, weather conditions, and crop characteristics. The model assists in improving farming efficiency and sustainability.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Agriculture involves complex environmental interactions. The goal of this project is to use historical data and machine learning models to:
- Predict crop yield
- Provide insights into sustainable farming practices
- Assist stakeholders in agricultural planning

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset includes features such as:
- Soil fertility metrics
- Weather conditions
- Crop characteristics
- Fertilizer inputs

The model learns from historical data to make predictions for new data.


## 📊 Model Used

This project uses:
- **Random Forest Classifier / Regression**
- Preprocessing of features
- Train-test split
- Performance evaluation using accuracy / RMSE (depending on task)
  

## 🛠 Tools and Technologies

- Python
- NumPy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook


## 📌 How It Works

1. Load and preprocess the agricultural dataset
2. Handle missing values and scale data if needed
3. Split data into train and test sets
4. Train the ML model (Random Forest)
5. Evaluate and interpret the model performance


## 📈 Results

- Model performance metrics (accuracy or prediction error) are displayed
- Results show how well the model performs on unseen data
- Confusion matrix / error metrics are included in the notebook
